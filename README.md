# I don't know how to code

Congratulations! You landed a job at Fang Inc as a software engineer. The
only problem is you don't know how to code. See how many review cycles you can
survive before you get fired.

Made for Ludum Dare 50 with the theme: delay the inevitable.

## Plan

* A card game.
* The resources are:
  * Mental health
  * Manager sentiment
  * Friend sentiment
  * Money
  * OKR Progress
* The cards will be standard things that you might do at work. But you'll eventually run out of options and get fired.
* I'm thinking of a Slay the Spire style deck building. You start with a standard deck and choose cards to add after each fight.

## Todos

* Cards UI
* Card logic engine
* Resource meters
* 30 cards content
* Card meta-game, choose a card to add to deck after each round
* Card art
* Elevator music
* Hmm, oh, aww, woohoo, sounds like office chatter for some cards.
